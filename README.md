# CS 330: 3D Scene Final Project Reflection

## Overview
This project showcases my ability to create a fully realized 3D scene. The scene includes objects such as AirPod buds, an AirPods case, a MacBook, an open planner with a pen, a glass, and a wooden table on a carpet. These components demonstrate my skills in computational graphics, including modeling, texturing, lighting, and interactivity.

## Reflection

### Approach
When designing software, I focus on breaking down complex requirements into manageable components. For this 3D scene:
- I analyzed the reference image and determined which primitive shapes (spheres, cylinders, boxes) to use.
- Textures and materials were applied to enhance realism, such as metallic textures for the MacBook and wood textures for the table.
- Lighting was meticulously crafted using a directional light for general illumination and a point light to highlight specific areas, creating dynamic shadows and enhancing depth.

This structured and iterative process ensured that each object was cohesive and aligned with the overall aesthetic. For example, the AirPods case was modeled using a horizontally stretched sphere with textures carefully aligned to avoid distortion.

### Design
This project helped me develop:
- Advanced texturing techniques to differentiate materials like wood, metal, and glass.
- Lighting design skills to balance ambient, diffuse, and specular light components for a realistic appearance.
- Modularity in design, using reusable functions (`SetTransformations`, `SetShaderMaterial`, `SetShaderTexture`) to simplify adjustments.

### Design process
I followed an iterative process:
1. Initial modeling of objects using basic shapes.
2. Application of textures to distinguish materials (e.g., a wood texture for the table, glass transparency for the cup).
3. Integration of lighting and shadows for realism.
4. Adding interactivity through camera controls and view toggling.

### Tactics from the design approach
- Breaking down requirements into smaller tasks ensures clarity and focus.
- Modular and reusable code improves efficiency and consistency.
- Iterative refinement helps produce polished and professional results.

### Developing programs
I emphasize modularity and iteration in development:
- **Modularity**: Functions like `SetTransformations` and `SetShaderMaterial` were used to streamline object creation and ensure consistency.
- **Iteration**: Adjustments were made to positioning, textures, and lighting throughout the project to refine the scene.

For example, the glass used transparent materials with refractive properties and required multiple iterations to achieve realistic lighting effects.

### Development strategies
I utilized:
- **Texture mapping** to add realism, such as the planner's pages and the metallic look of the MacBook.
- **Lighting techniques** to simulate natural illumination and create realistic shadows.
- **Camera controls** to enable user interaction with the scene, including movement, orientation, and view toggling.

### Iteration factor
Iteration allowed me to:
- Continuously refine object placement, textures, and lighting for better realism.
- Test and improve user interactivity through keyboard and mouse controls.

### Developing code evolved throug the milestones?
Initially, I focused on creating individual objects. Over time, I developed reusable functions and modular code, making it easier to make global adjustments and maintain consistency.

### Computer science - my goals
This project has shown how computational graphics and visualization can enhance creativity and technical skills. These abilities are essential for future opportunities in:
- **Education**: Developing interactive simulations or visual tools.
- **Profession**: Creating immersive experiences in fields like game development or virtual reality.

### Computational graphics and visualizations
- **Educational pathway**: Learning advanced techniques like texture mapping, lighting, and interactivity prepares me for more complex projects.
- **Professional pathway**: These skills are applicable to creating engaging user experiences in applications such as virtual environments or data visualization.

## Conclusion
This project was a culmination of skills learned throughout the course, integrating modeling, texturing, lighting, and interactivity. The result is a dynamic and visually appealing 3D scene that reflects both technical and creative aspects of computational graphics.
